# Slynthesizer
Slynthesizer finally gives you the chance to experience Blaseball using the one* sense organ that isn't officially supported by The Game Band: your ears!  
All aspects of the game state are used to tweak the values for multiple synthesizers to combine into a unique and parseable** soundscape.  
You can finally escape the boredom of white text on black to revel in the heart-pounding tension of non-integer time signatures and droning synths of ever-increasing pitch in total darkness!  
You thought every additional pitch brought more excitement in normal blaseball, just wait until you hear how many pitches are in here.

# Three Rules:
1. No Blaseball information presented visually, besides UI  
2. Every game state must be fully distinguishable in context
3. No samples, all sounds must be programmtically generated using synths

# How To:
Pressing "Click Me!" is necessary to start the audio because between [Blaseball '99](http://davidthelazar.com/blaseball99) and today, browsers have cracked down on autoplaying music.  
Choosing a date/time on the home page will start fetching game updates from [replay](https://sibr.dev/apis). Then, select from the games that were occurring at the selected time. This game's updates will then drive the synths, spending 4 seconds at each game state. Pressing the "I thought you said this was *cursed*" button will replace the synths with new ones with a bit more *flavor*. This choice is not currently**** reversible.

# How it Works:
Synths are generated and controlled using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).
