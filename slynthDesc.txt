Game update rate is 4sec

Main synth: 
--changes oscillator/voice based on home/away team batting
--All intervals below are relative to a major scale 
--increases root tone by half step every inning
--For each strike, increase the root tone in the ballpeggio below to the major [4, 5, 7, 9] above the inning root
--rising arpeggio of 2^(balls) tones each update  [root],3],5,6],7,8,10,12],13,15,17,18,19,20,22,24] major intervals relative to strike+inning root
--each out increases the frequency and depth of the wiggly low-pass filter

Simple sine synth:
--arpeggiates one note per occupied base at the major [1:4,2:6,3:7,4:15] above inning root, twice per game update

Percussion synths:
--home synth is kick-like, away synth is hihat-like
--one hit per abs(score) each game update
--synth voicing changes if score is negative
