Game update rate is 4sec

Main synth: 
--changes oscillator/voice based on home/away team batting
--increases root tone by half step every inning
--For each strike, increase all tones in the ballpeggio below by [3,4,6,8] half steps above root
--rising arpeggio of 2^(balls) tones each update, [0,2,4,5,6,7,9,11,12,14,16,17,18,19,21,23] half steps above strike+inning note
--each out increases the wiggliness frequency of the low-pass filter

Simple sine synth:
--arpeggiates one note per occupied base [1:3,2:5,3:6,4:14] half steps above inning root, twice per game update

Percussion synths:
--home synth is kick-like, away synth is hihat-like
--one hit per abs(score) each game update
--synth voicing changes if score is negative
